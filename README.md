## Snappy-Clone

Snapp-Clone is a React.Js project that offers a different kind of experience compared to my other projects. With this build one has to allow the web app to access the camera and proceed. The project was more of a backend project, behind the scenes a lot happens.

The build features React.JS, React-redux, google auth and styled components.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/components`.The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
